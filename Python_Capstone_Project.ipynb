        "\n",
        "Over the past 30 years, the S&P 500 index has delivered a compound average annual growth rate of 10.7% per year. While this a relatively attractive return on investment, the actual returns tend to vary based upon the timing of the investment—e.g.,the S&P 500 index delivered a five-year return of -6.6% a year over the five years ending in February 2009, while it delivered a return of 30% a year over the five years ending in July 1987.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, to determine an optimal point of entry Two Sample t-Tests will be conducted using: S&P 500 price earnings ratio (PE Ratio) and year-over-year percentage change in 10-year treasury yield  (DGS10) as independent variables, and 5yr forward return on S&P 500 as dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first variable, PE ratio, is selected to test the age old adage of \"Buy low, Sell High.\" A straight-forward measure calculated by dividing the price by earnings, this ratio acts as a metric showing how expensive the index is with repect to its earnigns. \n",
        "\n",
        "The second variable, 10-year treasury yield is a closely watched as an indicator of broader investor confidence. The 10-year is used as a proxy for many other important financial matters, such as mortgage rates. This bond also tends to signal investor confidence. The U.S Treasury sells bonds via auction and yields are set through a bidding process.5 When confidence is high, prices for the 10-year drop, and yields rise. \n",

        "\n",
        "Inferring from the results of out t-Tests, we can safely say that investing when S&P 500's PE ratio is low rather than when it is high has yeilded higher returns 95% of the time. The difference in mean returns being 21% higher.\n",
        "Similarly, we can also deduce that investing in S&P 500 when 10-year Treasury yileds are in a decreasing trend (year-over-year) yileds higher returns 95% of the time. The difference in mean returns here being 11% higher.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Recommendations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the conclusion reach, the study would recommend investors invest/invest more when PE ratio is less than or equal to 14 and/or 10-year Treasury yeilds are decreasing on a year-over-year basis. More specifially, this study provides sufficient evidence against Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) investment, wherein an investor allocates a set amount of money at regular intervals, usually shorter than a year (monthly or quarterly). Futhermore, it provides strong evidence for lump-sum investing based on PE ratio and trend of 10-year Treasury yields. One can even take it a step further by modifying the DCA and increasing the amount invested while PE ratio is low and/or 10-year Treasury yeilds are trending lower, and vice-versa.\n"
